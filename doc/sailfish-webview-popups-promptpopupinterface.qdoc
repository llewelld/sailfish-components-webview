  \qmltype PromptPopupInterface
  \inqmlmodule Sailfish.WebView.Popups
  \ingroup sailfishos-webview-popups
  \brief A component which defines the interface for the input prompt popup
  \inherits UserPromptInterface

  The \c{PromptPopupInterface} QML type is exposed through the
  \c{Sailfish.WebView.Popups} QML import namespace.

  Clients who use a \l{WebView} in their application may wish to
  customize the appearance or behavior of the input prompt popup in their
  application.

  To do so, their implementation must extend the \c{PromptPopupInterface},
  which itself extends the \l{UserPromptInterface}, and then they must
  tell the \l{WebView} to use their implementation via the \c{popupProvider}
  property.

  The key assigned to \l{Sailfish.WebView.Popups::UserPromptInterface::acceptText}
  {acceptText} will always be "OK" while the key assigned to
  \l{Sailfish.WebView.Popups::UserPromptInterface::cancelText}{cancelText}
  will always be "Cancel".

/*!
  \qmlproperty string PromptPopupInterface::text
  \brief The text to display as the prompt information message

  A custom implementation should bind the \c{text} property
  of their prompt information text label to the value of this property.

  This label will describe to the user what the site is asking them to
  enter information for, allowing the user to provide the appropriate
  information and make an informed acceptance or rejection decision.
*/

/*!
  \qmlproperty string PromptPopupInterface::value
  \brief The text value which the user provided via the prompt popup

  A custom implementation should bind this property to the \c{text}
  property of their \c{TextField} (or to the appropriate property of
  whatever input element is being used by the custom implementation to
  allow the user to provide data).

  It is an output property, whose value is read by the web view.
