  \brief A component which defines the interface for the location permission popup
  \inherits UserPromptInterface

  The \c{LocationPopupInterface} QML type is exposed through the
  \c{Sailfish.WebView.Popups} QML import namespace.

  Clients who use a \l{WebView} in their application may wish to
  customize the appearance or behavior of the location permission popup
  in their application.

  To do so, their implementation must extend the \c{LocationPopupInterface},
  which itself extends the \l{UserPromptInterface}, and then they must
  tell the \l{WebView} to use their implementation via the \c{popupProvider}
  property.

/*!
  \qmlproperty string LocationPopupInterface::host
  \brief The name of the site which is asking for permission to access the
         user's location

  A custom implementation should bind the \c{text} property
  of their geolocation permission information text label to the value of this
  property.

  This label will describe to the user which site is asking them for
  permission to see their location, allowing the user to make an informed
  acceptance or rejection decision.
*/

/*!
  \qmlproperty bool LocationPopupInterface::rememberValue
  \brief Whether the acceptance or rejection should be remembered for this
         site, in case it asks for location permission again in the future

  A custom implementation should bind this property to the \c{checked}
  property of their "remember for this site" toggle switch.

  It is an output property, whose value is read by the web view.
